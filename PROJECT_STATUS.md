## Project Health Metrics

### Development Infrastructure ‚úÖ HEALTHY
- Documentation system: Complete and well-structured
- Development guidelines: Comprehensive and domain-specific
- Architecture design: Detailed and technically sound
- Quality assurance: Testing methodology defined

### Technical Readiness üü° MODERATE
- Technology stack: Well-defined and appropriate
- Database schema: Designed but not implemented
- API architecture: Planned but not coded
- Performance targets: Defined but not validated

### Philosophical Domain Integration ‚úÖ STRONG
- User stories: Comprehensive coverage of research workflows
- Citation standards: Multiple formats supported
- Academic requirements: Rigor and accuracy prioritized
- Collaborative features: Designed for research teams

## Critical Issues
1. **Embedding service not implemented** - Core functionality for semantic search missing
2. **Search functionality not implemented** - Only stub implementations exist
3. **No database migrations** - Alembic not set up for schema versioning
4. **No integration tests** - Only unit tests with mocking currently exist
5. **External service dependencies** - Vertex AI, Zotero APIs not configured

## Next Immediate Actions

### Priority 1 - Core Service Implementation
1. ‚úÖ Update PROJECT_STATUS.md to reflect actual progress
2. Implement Vertex AI embedding service with authentication
3. Build actual search functionality (hybrid semantic + keyword)
4. Set up Alembic for database migrations
5. Create integration tests for MCP server with database

### Priority 2 - Document Processing Pipeline  
1. Implement PDF/EPUB content extraction
2. Create philosophical-aware text chunking
3. Build citation extraction and validation
4. Integrate with embedding generation
5. Add batch processing capabilities

### Priority 3 - Search and Analysis Features
1. Implement vector similarity search with pgvector
2. Build result fusion and re-ranking algorithms
3. Create concept genealogy tracing system
4. Develop argument mapping capabilities
5. Add performance optimization for < 200ms latency

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks üü° MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** Ambitious scope with multiple integrated systems
- **Performance:** 200ms search latency target may be challenging
- **Scalability:** Vector similarity search at scale needs validation
- **Integration:** Multiple external APIs (Vertex AI, Zotero) create dependencies

### Domain Risks üü¢ LOW
- **Academic Accuracy:** Strong emphasis on citation standards reduces risk
- **User Adoption:** Clear user stories and research workflows defined
- **Philosophical Validity:** Architecture respects philosophical research methods

### Project Risks üü° MEDIUM
- **Scope Creep:** Feature-rich system requires disciplined implementation
- **Timeline:** No specific milestones or deadlines established
- **Resource Allocation:** Solo development of complex system may require prioritization
