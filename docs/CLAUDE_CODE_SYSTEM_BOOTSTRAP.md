# Claude Code Development System Bootstrap
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Complete template system for initializing systematic, self-improving Claude Code development workflows in any workspace

## üéØ System Overview

The Claude Code Development System implements a cybernetic feedback loop that makes development increasingly reliable and error-resistant over time. It combines:

- **SPARC-V-L¬≥ Protocol:** Systematic development methodology
- **Triple-Log System:** Complete traceability and learning capture  
- **Verification Protocols:** Error prevention through systematic checks
- **Context Management:** Consistent decision-making through documentation

## üöÄ Quick Start: 60-Second Bootstrap

```bash
# 1. Create directory structure
mkdir -p docs/{decisions,analysis,planning} archive logs

# 2. Generate core files from templates (see Section 4)
touch CLAUDE.md DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md PROJECT_STATUS.md CHANGELOG.md
touch ACTIVITY_LOG.md FEEDBACK_LOG.md SELF_ANALYSIS_LOG.md
touch docs/ARCHITECTURE.md docs/TEST_SUITE_REPAIR_PLAN.md

# 3. Populate templates with your project specifics
# 4. Initialize git tracking for all logs
# 5. Begin first task following SPARC-V-L¬≥ protocol
```

## üìã System Components & Their Purposes

| Component | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Agent prime directive, current task context | Every task change |
| **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** | Core principles, patterns, verification protocols | When systemic lessons learned |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | System design, component relationships | When architecture evolves |
| **ACTIVITY_LOG.md** | Immutable record of all actions taken | Every agent response |
| **FEEDBACK_LOG.md** | Error capture, user corrections, deviations | When mistakes occur |
| **SELF_ANALYSIS_LOG.md** | Self-critique, insights, pattern recognition | After significant tasks |
| **PROJECT_STATUS.md** | High-level progress tracking | Weekly or at milestones |
| **CHANGELOG.md** | User-facing change documentation | At releases |

## üîß Document Templates

### Template 1: CLAUDE.md (Agent Prime Directive)

```markdown
# üéØ CURRENT TASK: {{CURRENT_TASK_DESCRIPTION}}
- **PLAN:** {{LINK_TO_RELEVANT_PLAN_DOC}}
- **STATUS:** {{CURRENT_PHASE_AND_STEP}}

---

## üß† CORE DIRECTIVES (VERIFY ON EVERY ACTION)

1. **SPARC-V-L¬≥ Protocol:** You MUST follow the full SPARC-V-L¬≥ cycle for all non-trivial changes as detailed in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
2. **{{TESTING_METHODOLOGY}} is Non-Negotiable:** {{TESTING_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFIC_TO_PROJECT}}.
3. **{{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}} Compliance:** {{ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS}}.
4. **Verification is Mandatory:** {{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_VERIFICATION_REQUIREMENTS}}.
5. **Log All Anomalies:** Any deviation from the plan, unexpected error, or user correction MUST be logged with structured detail in `FEEDBACK_LOG.md`.
6. **Log Your Actions:** At the end of every response, you MUST append a structured entry to `ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
7. **Self-Critique:** After completing a significant task, you MUST perform a self-analysis and log it in `SELF_ANALYSIS_LOG.md`.

---

## üîÑ CONTEXT INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY:** Execute this protocol at the start of EVERY conversation and whenever context may have been compacted/refreshed.

### Context Refresh Detection Triggers:
- Beginning of any new conversation
- When you cannot recall recent task details or decisions
- When foundational documents are not in working memory
- When {{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_CONTEXT_TRIGGERS}}

### IMMEDIATE INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE:
1. **ALWAYS READ FIRST:** 
   - `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Core principles, patterns, and methodologies
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and component relationships  
   - `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project state and progress
   - `FEEDBACK_LOG.md` - Recent lessons and workflow decisions

2. **VERIFY UNDERSTANDING:**
   - {{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}} requirements
   - {{TESTING_METHODOLOGY}} methodology
   - SPARC-V-L¬≥ protocol compliance
   - {{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_WORKFLOW_DECISIONS}}

3. **LOAD PROJECT CONTEXT:**
   - Current task status and priorities
   - Recent architectural decisions and patterns
   - Active issues and their resolution approaches

**NEVER SKIP THIS PROTOCOL** - Inconsistent decisions result from missing foundational context.

---

## üìö KNOWLEDGE BASE INTERACTION PROTOCOL

You are required to read the following documents at specific trigger points:

- **WHEN:** Starting *any* new task.
  - **READ:** `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` to refresh core principles.
  - **READ:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the system context.
  - **READ:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to understand the current state.

- **WHEN:** {{PROJECT_TYPE_SPECIFIC_TRIGGER_1}}.
  - **READ:** {{RELEVANT_DOCS_1}}.

- **WHEN:** {{PROJECT_TYPE_SPECIFIC_TRIGGER_2}}.
  - **READ:** {{RELEVANT_DOCS_2}}.

- **WHEN:** A significant architectural decision is needed.
  - **ACTION:** Propose a new Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `docs/decisions/`.

- **WHEN:** A task is complete.
  - **ACTION:** Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and `SELF_ANALYSIS_LOG.md`.
  - **ACTION:** If systemic lesson learned, update `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.

## üß† Meta-Learning: Improving This Template

As you use this system, capture improvements in your project's `FEEDBACK_LOG.md`:
- Which template sections needed the most customization?
- What project-specific patterns emerged that should be added?
- Which verification protocols proved most valuable?
- What context initialization steps were missing?

This meta-feedback can improve future template versions, making the bootstrap process increasingly effective.

**Remember:** This system's power comes from consistent application. The protocols may feel over-engineered initially, but they prevent entire classes of errors and create increasingly reliable development workflows over time.
