### Initial Bootstrap Implementation - Lesson Learned

**Issue:** Initial CLAUDE.md implementation lost project-specific content
**Context:** When first implementing bootstrap template, replaced existing valuable project content instead of integrating it
**User Correction:** "you need to combine what is already there with the specifications in the bootstrap file. Like don't lose any information / specificity, you should be adding and enhance or integrating the instructions"
**Resolution:** Properly merged existing philosophical research project content with bootstrap template structure
**Learning:** Always preserve existing project-specific information when applying templates - enhance rather than replace
**Pattern to Remember:** Integration > Replacement when applying systematic improvements

**System Impact:** 
- Established proper integration methodology for future template applications
- Preserved all domain-specific requirements while gaining systematic development structure
- Created reusable pattern for template integration

**Process Improvement:**
- When applying templates: Always read existing content first
- Identify valuable project-specific information before making changes  
- Merge systematically rather than replacing wholesale
- Verify no important context is lost in integration process
